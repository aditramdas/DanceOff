# WHackers-Dance Off

We have inculcated technology into everything around us, except for one thing: dance. Haven't
you ever felt that you are not getting an opportunity to pursue a career as a dancer, not only as a
profession but also out of interest? When one wants to learn to dance, he is forced to find a
teacher. If one learns from a video, he or she is unsure if the steps are correct. People also don't
dance for the following reasons: It may be due to lack of a mentor, or it may be that he/she is
ashamed of going to a mentor and learning dance at this age, or he/she may have a busy schedule
and not find enough time for it. On the other hand, there are many unknown choreographers with
amazing talents who donâ€™t find the right customers and are hence getting paid less.

## Project Description

Our idea is an ML based app, which not only shows us the dance steps, but also shows the level
of correctness with which the steps were performed by the user, i.e. an app which not only
teaches dance but also act as a personal tutor. A video footage will be shown to the user and
he/she needs to dance in similar way. The app will point out the mistakes made by the user and
help him/her to correct it instantly. Choreographers can upload their dance moves to the website,
hence enabling the trainee to choose the video of their favourite choreographers.
